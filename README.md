<h3>About</h3>
<p>I'm a third year computing science student studying in Scotland. My main interests are in functional programming, front end web development, and building games and algorithm visualisers in the browser</p>

<h3>Languages and Technologies</h3>
<p>For front end web apps I use React and TypeScript. I'm currently rebuilding some of my old vanilla JavaScript projects to learn Reacts features</p>
<p>For functional programming I use Haskell. I've mainly spent my time reading about the theory, so I've only built a couple of projects using it</p>
<p>For desktop apps I use Java and Swing</p>
